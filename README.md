----

The packages in this repository are automatically updated using [AU](https://github.com/majkinetor/au).

----

These are lower priority packages for me as compared to the packages in TheCakeIsNaOH/chocolatey-packages. I have no SLA for updating/fixing these packages. 
I welcome any other maintainers who want to take over any of these packages. 

Files for each package are located in their own directories, with the exception of the icons, which are located in the `Icons` directory.
